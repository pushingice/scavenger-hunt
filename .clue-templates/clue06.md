### Clue 6: Which `which` is which? ###

#### `which` ####

In the previous clue we learned about `PATH`. This tells the computer where to
find binary programs we can run. But, how do we find where a specific program
is? The answer is `which`:

    which mv
    
This should print `/bin/mv`. This tells us that the `mv` command is installed
in the `/bin/` directory. `which` itself is a program so you could try:

    which which

#### Finding Clue 7 ####

`python` is a program we have been using to generate and test our clues. Your 
next hint is the location of the `python` program.
